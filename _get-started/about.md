### You focus on your content.

Isomer is an informational website builder for the government. 

GovTech creates and manages the design for all Isomer sites, provides the hosting, and ensures that your site remains accessible, secure, and fast. 

> All you have to do is to prepare the content, and Isomer "builds" a fully featured and fully compliant site.

This model works very well for sites which are informational in nature such as corporate sites.

### We take care of compliance for you

We understand that all Internet-facing systems have to comply to clauses stated in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8). 

We've designed Isomer to be compliant to applicable clauses in the IM8 and follow the recommended guidelines by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.sg). Since all sites on Isomer share the same infrastructure and pull from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews yielding the same result.

If you have specific queries regarding IM8 compliance, please contact any of the Isomer team members and we'll help you address them. 

### In line with Singapore Government Design System

Our site templates are designed based on components found on the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg). If you choose to build a site on your own, you can still refer to the UI components found on their site.

*Note that the current components may not be up to date with the latest SGDS.*
