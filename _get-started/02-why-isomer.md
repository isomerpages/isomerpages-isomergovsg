### Isomer is static
All isomer sites are static. Launching a static site means that there is no database, no server patches required since no complicated server side scripts and processes running for your webpage to be rendered on the browser.

Your website structure is much simpler. Your pages are simply files (just like your word or excel documents on your File Explorer).

You can read more about the benefits of having a static site [here](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/5-reasons-static-sites-rock). 

However, dynamic sites (hosted on CWP) could still be relevant if your site requires content to be dynamically generated such as the ability for users to log into their individual accounts. 

> If your site is purely informational, there is no need for you to build a dynamic site that is harder to maintain and will cost you more.

### Isomer is fast 

A static site, coupled with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) will make your site load much faster. Webpages are pre-rendered and stored in your CDN instead of being dynamically generated from the server like those on dynamic sites.

### Isomer is more secure

All sites hosted on isomer are maintained centrally by the isomer team through a global template, using the same infrastructure. The only difference between different sites is your content.

Isomer team conducts regular Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Testing (VAPT), and ensures that only whitelisted scripts are able to run on your sites. 

> Note that we will not allow any custom scripts to run on isomer sites.

### We take care of compliance for you

We understand that all internet facing systems has to comply to clauses stated in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8). 

We've designed Isomer to be compliant to applicable clauses on IM8 and follow the recommended guidelines by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.sg). Since all sites on Isomer is sharing the same infrastructure and pulling from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews yielding the same result.

If you have specific queries regarding im8 compliance, please contact any of the isomer team members and we'll help you address them.
