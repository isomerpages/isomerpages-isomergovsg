#### Facebook Pixel
The Facebook Pixel collects data that helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to people who have already taken some kind of action on your website.

You can refer to their instructions [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142)

You should not copy the code block that is provided by Facebook, but instead copy the Facebook Pixel ID that is provided and paste it within the `config.yml` file in the following format:

```yml
facebook-pixel: <Your Facebook Pixel code>
```
